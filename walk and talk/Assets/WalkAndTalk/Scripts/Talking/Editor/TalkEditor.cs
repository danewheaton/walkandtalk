         * INSTANT PREVIEW
         * - on each line, have a button that says "preview"
         * - when this button is clicked, the talker appears in the scene view performing the line, including anims, movement, etc
         * - I'm not 100% sure how I want to handle previewing stuff involving multiple characters, like how to arrange them in the scene etc
         * - if there are more lines after that one, the talker performs those too
         * - clicking any preview buttons or pressing a hotkey exits instant preview
