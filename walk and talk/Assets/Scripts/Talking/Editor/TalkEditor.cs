         *
         * INSTANT PREVIEW
         * - on each line, have a button that says "preview"
         * - when this button is clicked, the talker appears in the scene view performing the line, including anims, movement, etc
         * - I'm not 100% sure how I want to handle previewing stuff involving multiple characters, like how to arrange them in the scene etc
         * - if there are more lines after that one, the talker performs those too
         * - clicking any preview buttons or pressing a hotkey exits instant preview
         * 
         * COMPATIBILITY
         * - I remember a popular old-school dialogue system that was simply called "dialogue system for unity" or something, maybe be compatible with that
         * - definitely compatible with ink
         * - definitely compatible with yarn/yarnspinner/whatever
         * - definitely compatible with whatever unity UI solutions are popular this week (textMeshPro, whatever "UI toolkit" is, legacy, whatever whatever bleh)
         * - should also have a standalone homebrew option for users who don't want any unity packages
