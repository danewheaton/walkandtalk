    // not even going to include this in the walk and talk namespace, just made this in case later I want to experiment with rolling my own systems
    // the main goal in doing so would just be to make it easy to find where gameplay-relevant events/variables are used throughout open scenes and the project
    // event stuff: responders and firers, local and global registries, events that take arguments, actually maybe forget events and just do condition action responders
    // variable stuff: local and global banks, and maybe just collections of actual normal legit variables (not special wrapper classes)
