public class PoseEditor
{
    /* I have no idea how to code editor stuff, so for right now I am just using this class to think through my feature wishlist
     *
     * POSING TOOL
     * - on a rigged gameObject, have a button that says "pose"
     * - when this button is clicked, gizmos appear that allow the user to easily make poses with the rig
     * - works in both scene view and prefab mode
     * - user can easily define which joints they care about for each rig
     * - click the button again to export pose to an animation file and exit posing mode
     * - while posing, there is another button for exporting that does not exit posing mode, so the user can keep working from the current pose
     *
     * COMPATIBILITY
     * - should be compatible with unity's animation rigging package
     * - should also have a standalone homebrew option for users who don't want any unity packages
